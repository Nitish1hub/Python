## Installing Python

Python is cross-platform, meaning it runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, the installation process differs slightly for each operating system. Let's explore the detailed installation steps for each platform.

### Windows

#### Step 1: Download Python

1. Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Click on the **"Download Python 3.x.x"** button (where 3.x.x is the latest version)
3. Alternatively, scroll down to find specific versions if you need an older release

#### Step 2: Run the Installer

1. Locate the downloaded file (usually in your `Downloads` folder): `python-3.x.x-amd64.exe`
2. **Double-click** the installer to run it
3. **IMPORTANT**: Before clicking "Install Now", make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python 3.x to PATH"**
   - This is crucial! It allows you to run Python from the command line anywhere on your system
4. Click **"Install Now"** for the standard installation, or choose **"Customize installation"** for advanced options
5. Wait for the installation to complete
6. Click **"Close"** when finished

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

1. Open **Command Prompt** (press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter)
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
3. You should see output like: `Python 3.x.x`
4. Also verify pip is installed:
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

**Troubleshooting Windows**:
- If `python --version` doesn't work, try `py --version` instead (Windows Python Launcher)
- If neither works, Python wasn't added to PATH. You'll need to add it manually (see the PATH section below)
- Make sure to restart your command prompt after installation

---

### macOS

#### Step 1: Check if Python is Pre-installed

1. Open **Terminal** (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter)
2. Check the Python version:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
3. macOS comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed (on older versions), but you'll want Python 3.x

#### Step 2: Download Python

**Option A: Official Installer (Recommended for Beginners)**

1. Visit [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest macOS installer (`.pkg` file)
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation wizard
4. Click through the prompts and enter your password when requested
5. Complete the installation

**Option B: Using Homebrew (Recommended for Developers)**

1. First, install Homebrew if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Install Python using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```
3. Homebrew automatically handles PATH configuration

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

1. Open Terminal
2. Check the Python version:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
3. Verify pip installation:
   ```bash
   pip3 --version
   ```

**macOS Notes**:
- On macOS, you typically use `python3` and `pip3` commands (not just `python` and `pip`)
- The system Python 2.7 (if present) should not be modified or removed
- You can create an alias for convenience by adding this to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
  ```bash
  alias python=python3
  alias pip=pip3
  ```

---

### Linux

Python is often pre-installed on most Linux distributions, but it's good to ensure you have the latest version.

#### Step 1: Check Current Python Version

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
python3 --version
```

#### Step 2: Install or Update Python

**For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:**

1. Update package lists:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install Python 3:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```
3. For development tools (recommended):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-dev python3-venv
   ```

**For Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:**

1. Update system:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update
   ```
2. Install Python 3:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
   ```

**For Arch Linux:**

1. Update system:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```
2. Install Python:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S python python-pip
   ```

**For openSUSE:**

```bash
sudo zypper install python3 python3-pip
```

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

**Linux Notes**:
- Most Linux distributions use `python3` and `pip3` commands
- Never remove the system Python installation as many system tools depend on it
- Consider using virtual environments for project isolation (more on this later)

## What is PATH?

### Understanding PATH

The **PATH** is an environment variable that tells your operating system where to look for executable programs. When you type a command in the terminal or command prompt, the OS searches through all the directories listed in PATH to find the executable file.

### Why is PATH Important for Python?

When you install Python and add it to PATH, you can:
- Run Python from **any directory** without specifying the full path
- Use commands like `python`, `pip`, and other Python tools from anywhere
- Allow other programs and IDEs to automatically find your Python installation

### Example Without PATH

If Python is NOT in your PATH, you'd have to do this:
```bash
# Windows
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe script.py

# macOS/Linux
/usr/local/bin/python3 script.py
```

### Example With PATH

When Python IS in your PATH:
```bash
python script.py
```

Much simpler, right?

### How to Check Your PATH

**Windows:**
```cmd
echo %PATH%
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
echo $PATH
```

You'll see a list of directories separated by semicolons (Windows) or colons (Unix-like systems).

### How to Add Python to PATH Manually

**Windows:**

1. Search for **"Environment Variables"** in the Start menu
2. Click **"Edit the system environment variables"**
3. Click **"Environment Variables"** button
4. Under **"System variables"**, find and select **"Path"**
5. Click **"Edit"**
6. Click **"New"** and add the following paths (adjust version number):
   ```
   C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\
   C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts\
   ```
7. Click **"OK"** on all windows
8. **Restart** your command prompt

**macOS/Linux:**

Add this line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`):
```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin/python3:$PATH"
```

Then reload the configuration:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

## Running Your First Program

Now that you have Python and VS Code installed, let's write and run your first Python program!

### Step 1: Create a Project Folder

1. Create a new folder anywhere on your computer, e.g., `PythonProjects` or `my_first_python`
2. Open this folder in VS Code:
   - **File** → **Open Folder** → Select your folder
   - Or from terminal: `code /path/to/your/folder`

### Step 2: Create a Python File

1. In VS Code, click **"New File"** or press `Ctrl + N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + N` (macOS)
2. Save the file as `hello.py` (the `.py` extension indicates it's a Python file)

### Step 3: Write Your First Code

Type the following code into `hello.py`:

```python
# This is my first Python program
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python programming!")

# Let's do some basic math
x = 10
y = 20
result = x + y
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {result}")

# Get user input
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}!")
```

### Step 4: Run the Program

**Method 1: Using VS Code's Run Button**

1. Click the **"Run"** button (▶️) in the top-right corner of VS Code
2. Or press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + F5` (macOS)
3. Select "Python File" if prompted
4. The output will appear in the integrated terminal at the bottom

**Method 2: Using the Terminal**

1. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code: `Ctrl + ` ` (backtick) or **Terminal** → **New Terminal**
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python hello.py
   
   # macOS/Linux
   python3 hello.py
   ```

### Step 5: Interact with Your Program

When you run the program, you'll see:
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to Python programming!
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
What is your name?
```

Type your name and press Enter. The program will greet you!

### Understanding the Code

```python
# This is a comment - it's not executed

print("Hello, World!")  # Displays text to the screen

x = 10  # Variable assignment
y = 20

result = x + y  # Performs addition

print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {result}")  # f-string for formatting

name = input("What is your name? ")  # Gets input from user
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "Python is not recognized as a command"
- **Solution**: Python is not in your PATH. Reinstall Python and check "Add to PATH", or add it manually.

**Issue**: "No Python interpreter selected"
- **Solution**: Click on the Python version in the bottom-left of VS Code and select your Python installation.

**Issue**: Program doesn't run
- **Solution**: Make sure you've saved the file with a `.py` extension and selected the correct Python interpreter.

## What is a Library?

### Understanding Libraries

**Library** - A collection of pre-written code (functions, classes, modules) that you can use in your programs to avoid "reinventing the wheel".

**Real-World Analogy:**
Think of a library like a real book library:
- Instead of writing your own books (code), you borrow books (libraries) that experts have already written
- Each book (library) covers specific topics (functionality)
- You don't need to know how the book was written, just how to read and use it

### Why Use Libraries?

**✅ Save Time**
- Don't write code that already exists
- Use tested, reliable solutions

**✅ Add Powerful Features**
- Complex tasks become simple
- Access expert implementations

**✅ Focus on Your Project**
- Spend time on unique features
- Let libraries handle common tasks

### Types of Libraries

**1. Standard Library (Built-in)**
- Comes with Python automatically
- No installation needed
- Examples: `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `os`

**2. Third-Party Libraries (External)**
- Created by Python community
- Needs installation using pip
- Examples: `requests`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `flask`

### How Libraries Work

```python
# Step 1: Import the library
import math

# Step 2: Use its functions
result = math.sqrt(16)  # Square root
print(result)  # Output: 4.0

area = math.pi * (5 ** 2)  # Area of circle
print(f"Area: {area:.2f}")  # Output: Area: 78.54
```

**What happens behind the scenes?**
1. Python finds the `math` library (it's built-in)
2. Loads all its functions and constants into memory
3. You can now use `math.sqrt()`, `math.pi`, etc.

### Simple Built-in Library Examples

#### Example 1: Math Library

```python
import math

# Constants
print(math.pi)      # 3.141592653589793
print(math.e)       # 2.718281828459045

# Functions
print(math.sqrt(25))           # 5.0 (square root)
print(math.pow(2, 3))          # 8.0 (2 to the power 3)
print(math.floor(3.7))         # 3 (round down)
print(math.ceil(3.2))          # 4 (round up)
print(math.factorial(5))       # 120 (5! = 5*4*3*2*1)
```

#### Example 2: Random Library

```python
import random

# Random integer between 1 and 10
dice = random.randint(1, 6)
print(f"Dice roll: {dice}")

# Random choice from a list
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
chosen = random.choice(colors)
print(f"Random color: {chosen}")

# Shuffle a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(numbers)
print(f"Shuffled: {numbers}")
```

#### Example 3: Datetime Library

```python
import datetime

# Current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(f"Current time: {now}")

# Current date only
today = datetime.date.today()
print(f"Today: {today}")

# Create specific date
birthday = datetime.date(1990, 5, 15)
print(f"Birthday: {birthday}")

# Calculate age
age = today.year - birthday.year
print(f"Age: {age} years")
```

#### Example 4: OS Library (Operating System)

```python
import os

# Get current working directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current directory: {current_dir}")

# List files in directory
files = os.listdir()
print(f"Files: {files}")

# Check if file exists
exists = os.path.exists("example.txt")
print(f"File exists: {exists}")
```

### Importing Libraries (Different Ways)

**Method 1: Import Entire Library**
```python
import math
result = math.sqrt(16)
```

**Method 2: Import with Alias (Shorter Name)**
```python
import math as m
result = m.sqrt(16)
```

**Method 3: Import Specific Function**
```python
from math import sqrt
result = sqrt(16)  # No need for math.sqrt()
```

**Method 4: Import Multiple Functions**
```python
from math import sqrt, pi, pow
result = sqrt(16)
area = pi * pow(5, 2)
```

**Method 5: Import Everything (Not Recommended)**
```python
from math import *
result = sqrt(16)  # Can use all functions directly
# Warning: Can cause naming conflicts!
```

### Real-Life Example: Simple Calculator

```python
import math

def advanced_calculator():
    """Calculator using math library"""
    
    print("=== Advanced Calculator ===")
    print("1. Square Root")
    print("2. Power")
    print("3. Circle Area")
    print("4. Sine/Cosine")
    
    choice = input("Choose operation (1-4): ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        num = float(input("Enter number: "))
        result = math.sqrt(num)
        print(f"√{num} = {result}")
    
    elif choice == "2":
        base = float(input("Enter base: "))
        exp = float(input("Enter exponent: "))
        result = math.pow(base, exp)
        print(f"{base}^{exp} = {result}")
    
    elif choice == "3":
        radius = float(input("Enter radius: "))
        area = math.pi * math.pow(radius, 2)
        print(f"Area = {area:.2f}")
    
    elif choice == "4":
        angle = float(input("Enter angle (degrees): "))
        radians = math.radians(angle)  # Convert to radians
        print(f"Sin({angle}°) = {math.sin(radians):.4f}")
        print(f"Cos({angle}°) = {math.cos(radians):.4f}")

# Run calculator
advanced_calculator()
```

## What is pip?

### Understanding pip

**pip** stands for "Pip Installs Packages" (a recursive acronym). It's the **package manager** for Python, allowing you to easily install and manage additional libraries and frameworks that don't come with Python's standard library.

### Why is pip Important?

Python's standard library is powerful, but you'll often need specialized functionality:
- **Web scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
- **Data science**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Web development**: Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **Machine learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Image processing**: Pillow
- **And thousands more...**

pip makes installing these packages as simple as running one command.

### Basic pip Commands

#### Check pip Version
```bash
# Windows
pip --version

# macOS/Linux
pip3 --version
```

#### Install a Package
```bash
# Windows
pip install package_name

# macOS/Linux
pip3 install package_name

# Example: Install the requests library
pip install requests
```

#### Install a Specific Version
```bash
pip install package_name==1.2.3

# Example
pip install django==4.2.0
```

#### Upgrade a Package
```bash
pip install --upgrade package_name

# Example
pip install --upgrade requests
```

#### Uninstall a Package
```bash
pip uninstall package_name

# Example
pip uninstall requests
```

#### List Installed Packages
```bash
pip list
```

#### Show Package Information
```bash
pip show package_name

# Example
pip show requests
```

#### Search for Packages (deprecated in newer versions)
```bash
pip search package_name
```
Note: pip search is often disabled. Use [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/) to search for packages instead.

### Using requirements.txt

When working on projects, it's common to use a `requirements.txt` file that lists all dependencies:

**Create requirements.txt:**
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Install from requirements.txt:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Example requirements.txt:**
```txt
requests==2.31.0
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.2
matplotlib==3.7.1
```

### Virtual Environments and pip

It's best practice to use **virtual environments** for each project to avoid package conflicts:

**Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv myenv

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv myenv
```

**Activate the virtual environment:**
```bash
# Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source myenv/bin/activate
```

**Install packages in the virtual environment:**
```bash
pip install requests pandas numpy
```

**Deactivate when done:**
```bash
deactivate
```

### PyPI - The Python Package Index

All packages that pip installs come from **PyPI** ([https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/)), the official repository for Python packages. Anyone can publish packages to PyPI, which is why Python has such a rich ecosystem.

### Example: Installing and Using a Package

Let's install and use the `requests` library:

1. **Install requests:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. **Create a new file** `test_requests.py`:
   ```python
   import requests
   
   # Make a request to a website
   response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')
   
   print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
   print(f"Content Type: {response.headers['content-type']}")
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   python test_requests.py
   ```

### Upgrading pip Itself

pip can be upgraded using pip:

```bash
# Windows
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Common pip Issues

**Issue**: "pip is not recognized"
- **Solution**: Make sure Python's Scripts folder is in your PATH. Use `python -m pip` instead of just `pip`.

**Issue**: Permission denied when installing packages
- **Solution**: 
  - Use `--user` flag: `pip install --user package_name`
  - Or use a virtual environment (recommended)
  - On Linux/macOS, avoid using `sudo pip` (use virtual environments instead)

**Issue**: SSL Certificate errors
- **Solution**: Update certificates or use `--trusted-host`:
  ```bash
  pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org package_name
  ```
