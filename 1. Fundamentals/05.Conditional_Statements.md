## Introduction - Making Decisions

Imagine you're standing at a traffic light:

- **If** the light is green → You go
- **If** the light is yellow → You slow down
- **If** the light is red → You stop

This is **decision-making** based on conditions. In real life, we make hundreds of decisions every day!

**In programming, computers need to make decisions too:**
- Should I display an error message?
- Is the password correct?
- Is the user old enough to vote?
- Does the shopping cart have items?

**In this blog, you'll learn:**
- How to make programs that choose different paths
- Using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements
- Creating smart, interactive programs
- Real-world decision-making in code

## What is a Condition?

Before we learn about `if` statements, we need to understand **conditions**.

**Define: Condition** - A statement that can be either **True** or **False**.

Think of it like asking a yes/no question:
- "Is it raining?" → Yes (True) or No (False)
- "Are you hungry?" → Yes (True) or No (False)
- "Is the number greater than 10?" → Yes (True) or No (False)

In Python, conditions use **comparison operators** (which we learned in Chapter 2):

### Quick Review of Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `==` | Equal to | `5 == 5` | True |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `5 != 3` | True |
| `>` | Greater than | `5 > 3` | True |
| `<` | Less than | `5 < 3` | False |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal | `5 >= 5` | True |
| `<=` | Less than or equal | `3 <= 5` | True |

### Condition Examples

```python
# These are all conditions (they evaluate to True or False)

age = 18
print(age >= 18)  # True

temperature = 25
print(temperature > 30)  # False

name = "Alice"
print(name == "Alice")  # True

score = 85
print(score < 50)  # False
```

**Key Point:** A condition always gives us either `True` or `False`.

---

## The `if` Statement

Now that we understand conditions, let's use them to make decisions!

**Define: `if` statement** - A way to run code ONLY if a condition is True.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of an automatic door:
- **IF** someone approaches → the door opens
- **IF** nobody is there → the door stays closed

### Basic Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # This code runs ONLY if condition is True
    # Notice the indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab)
```

**Important parts:**
1. `if` keyword
2. Condition (something that is True or False)
3. Colon (`:`) at the end
4. **Indentation** - the code inside must be indented

**Define: Indentation** - Spaces at the beginning of a line that show which code belongs to the `if` statement.

### Simple Example

```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
    print("You can vote")
    
# Output:
# You are an adult
# You can vote
```

**What happened?**
1. Python checks: Is `age >= 18`?
2. Yes! (20 is greater than or equal to 18)
3. So Python runs the indented code
4. Both print statements execute

### Example Where Condition is False

```python
age = 15

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
    print("You can vote")
    
print("This always runs")

# Output:
# This always runs
```

**What happened?**
1. Python checks: Is `age >= 18`?
2. No! (15 is less than 18)
3. So Python SKIPS the indented code
4. Only the last print runs (it's not indented, so it always runs)

### More Examples

```python
# Example 1: Temperature check
temperature = 35

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside!")
    print("Drink water and stay cool")

# Output:
# It's hot outside!
# Drink water and stay cool
```

```python
# Example 2: Password check
password = "secret123"
user_input = "secret123"

if password == user_input:
    print("Access granted!")
    print("Welcome back!")

# Output:
# Access granted!
# Welcome back!
```

```python
# Example 3: Number check
number = 42

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number")

# Output:
# This is an even number
```

---

## The `else` Statement

What if we want to do something DIFFERENT when the condition is False?

**Define: `else` statement** - Code that runs when the `if` condition is False.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of choosing ice cream flavors:
- **IF** they have chocolate → get chocolate
- **ELSE** (if they don't have chocolate) → get vanilla

### Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # Runs if condition is True
else:
    # Runs if condition is False
```

### Example

```python
age = 15

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("You are a minor")
    print("You cannot vote yet")

# Output:
# You are a minor
# You cannot vote yet
```

**What happened?**
1. Python checks: Is `age >= 18`?
2. No! (15 is less than 18)
3. So Python SKIPS the `if` block
4. Python runs the `else` block instead

### More if-else Examples

```python
# Example 1: Pass or Fail
score = 45

if score >= 50:
    print("You passed!")
else:
    print("You failed. Please try again.")

# Output:
# You failed. Please try again.
```

```python
# Example 2: Positive or Negative
number = -5

if number >= 0:
    print("This is a positive number")
else:
    print("This is a negative number")

# Output:
# This is a negative number
```

```python
# Example 3: Login System
correct_password = "python123"
user_password = "wrong_password"

if user_password == correct_password:
    print("Login successful!")
    print("Welcome to your account")
else:
    print("Incorrect password")
    print("Please try again")

# Output:
# Incorrect password
# Please try again
```

---

## The `elif` Statement

What if we have MORE than two choices?

**Define: `elif`** - Short for "else if". It checks another condition if the previous `if` was False.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of a restaurant menu:
- **IF** you want breakfast → serve breakfast menu
- **ELIF** (else if) you want lunch → serve lunch menu
- **ELIF** (else if) you want dinner → serve dinner menu
- **ELSE** → sorry, we're closed

### Syntax

```python
if condition1:
    # Runs if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # Runs if condition1 and condition2 are False AND condition3 is True
else:
    # Runs if all conditions are False
```

### Example: Grade Calculator

```python
score = 75

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
    print("Excellent work!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
    print("Very good!")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
    print("Good job!")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
    print("You passed")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
    print("Failed. Please study more")

# Output:
# Grade: C
# Good job!
```

**How it works:**
1. Check: Is `score >= 90`? → No (75 is less than 90)
2. Check: Is `score >= 80`? → No (75 is less than 80)
3. Check: Is `score >= 70`? → Yes! (75 is greater than or equal to 70)
4. Run that block and STOP checking the rest

**Important:** Once one condition is True, Python stops checking the others!

### More elif Examples

```python
# Example 1: Traffic Light
light_color = "yellow"

if light_color == "green":
    print("Go!")
elif light_color == "yellow":
    print("Slow down!")
elif light_color == "red":
    print("Stop!")
else:
    print("Invalid light color")

# Output:
# Slow down!
```

```python
# Example 2: Age Categories
age = 25

if age < 13:
    print("You are a child")
elif age < 20:
    print("You are a teenager")
elif age < 60:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen")

# Output:
# You are an adult
```

```python
# Example 3: Temperature Description
temp = 28

if temp < 0:
    print("Freezing cold!")
elif temp < 10:
    print("Very cold")
elif temp < 20:
    print("Cold")
elif temp < 30:
    print("Pleasant")
else:
    print("Hot!")

# Output:
# Pleasant
```

## Nested Conditions

Sometimes we need to check a condition INSIDE another condition.

**Define: Nested conditions** - An `if` statement inside another `if` statement.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of entering a building:
- **IF** you have an access card:
  - **IF** the card is valid → enter
  - **ELSE** → card expired, access denied
- **ELSE** → no card, access denied

### Syntax

```python
if condition1:
    # This runs if condition1 is True
    
    if condition2:
        # This runs if BOTH condition1 AND condition2 are True
    else:
        # This runs if condition1 is True but condition2 is False
else:
    # This runs if condition1 is False
```

### Example: Movie Theater

```python
age = 16
has_ticket = True

if has_ticket:
    print("You have a ticket")
    
    if age >= 18:
        print("You can watch the R-rated movie")
    else:
        print("You can only watch PG movies")
else:
    print("Please buy a ticket first")

# Output:
# You have a ticket
# You can only watch PG movies
```

### More Nested Examples

```python
# Example 1: Login with username and password
username = "admin"
password = "pass123"

user_input_name = "admin"
user_input_pass = "pass123"

if user_input_name == username:
    print("Username correct")
    
    if user_input_pass == password:
        print("Password correct")
        print("Login successful!")
    else:
        print("Wrong password")
else:
    print("Username not found")

# Output:
# Username correct
# Password correct
# Login successful!
```

```python
# Example 2: Discount Calculator
is_member = True
purchase_amount = 150

if purchase_amount >= 100:
    print("Eligible for discount!")
    
    if is_member:
        print("Member discount: 20%")
        discount = purchase_amount * 0.20
    else:
        print("Non-member discount: 10%")
        discount = purchase_amount * 0.10
    
    final_price = purchase_amount - discount
    print("Final price:", final_price)
else:
    print("No discount available")
    print("Minimum purchase: $100")

# Output:
# Eligible for discount!
# Member discount: 20%
# Final price: 120.0
```

**Note:** Try to avoid too many nested levels. It makes code hard to read!

## Combining Conditions with Logical Operators

We can combine multiple conditions using **logical operators** (from Chapter 2).

### Quick Review of Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `and` | Both conditions must be True | `age >= 18 and has_license` |
| `or` | At least one must be True | `is_weekend or is_holiday` |
| `not` | Reverses the condition | `not is_raining` |

### Using `and` Operator

```python
# Both conditions must be True

age = 20
has_license = True

if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive!")
else:
    print("You cannot drive")

# Output:
# You can drive!
```

### Using `or` Operator

```python
# At least one condition must be True

day = "Saturday"

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("It's the weekend!")
    print("Time to relax")
else:
    print("It's a weekday")
    print("Time to work")

# Output:
# It's the weekend!
# Time to relax
```

### Using `not` Operator

```python
# Reverses the condition

is_raining = False

if not is_raining:
    print("No rain today!")
    print("Perfect for a picnic")
else:
    print("It's raining")
    print("Stay inside")

# Output:
# No rain today!
# Perfect for a picnic
```

### Complex Combinations

```python
# Example: Scholarship Eligibility
score = 85
attendance = 90
behavior = "good"

if score >= 80 and attendance >= 85 and behavior == "good":
    print("Congratulations! You qualify for the scholarship!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you don't meet the requirements")

# Output:
# Congratulations! You qualify for the scholarship!
```

```python
# Example: Weekend or Holiday Check
day = "Monday"
is_holiday = False

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday" or is_holiday:
    print("Enjoy your day off!")
else:
    print("Time for work")

# Output:
# Time for work
```

---

## Real-Life Practical Examples

Let's build some real-world programs!

### Example 1: Age Verification System

```python
# Program to check if someone can vote

name = "Alice"
age = 20
is_citizen = True

print("Voter Registration System")
print("Name:", name)

if age >= 18 and is_citizen:
    print("Status: ELIGIBLE TO VOTE")
    print("You can register to vote")
elif age >= 18 and not is_citizen:
    print("Status: NOT ELIGIBLE")
    print("Reason: Not a citizen")
elif age < 18 and is_citizen:
    print("Status: NOT ELIGIBLE")
    print("Reason: Too young")
    years_to_wait = 18 - age
    print("You can vote in", years_to_wait, "years")
else:
    print("Status: NOT ELIGIBLE")
    print("Reason: Not a citizen and too young")

# Output:
# Voter Registration System
# Name: Alice
# Status: ELIGIBLE TO VOTE
# You can register to vote
```

### Example 2: Simple Grade Calculator

```python
# Calculate grade based on score

student_name = "Bob"
score = 78

print("Grade Calculator")
print("Student:", student_name)
print("Score:", score)

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
    message = "Outstanding!"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
    message = "Excellent work!"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
    message = "Good job!"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
    message = "Passed, but needs improvement"
else:
    grade = "F"
    message = "Failed. Please retake the course"

print("Grade:", grade)
print("Feedback:", message)

# Output:
# Grade Calculator
# Student: Bob
# Score: 78
# Grade: C
# Feedback: Good job!
```

### Example 3: Login Simulation

```python
# Simple login system

print("=== Login System ===")

# Correct credentials (stored in system)
correct_username = "admin"
correct_password = "secret123"

# User input (what user types)
username = "admin"
password = "secret123"

print("Checking credentials...")

if username == correct_username:
    if password == correct_password:
        print("✓ Login Successful!")
        print("Welcome,", username)
        print("Access granted to dashboard")
    else:
        print("✗ Login Failed")
        print("Incorrect password")
else:
    print("✗ Login Failed")
    print("Username not found")

# Output:
# === Login System ===
# Checking credentials...
# ✓ Login Successful!
# Welcome, admin
# Access granted to dashboard
```

### Example 4: Discount Calculator

```python
# Calculate discount based on purchase amount

purchase_amount = 250
is_member = True

print("Shopping Cart")
print("Subtotal: $", purchase_amount)

if purchase_amount >= 200:
    if is_member:
        discount_percent = 25
        print("Member discount: 25%")
    else:
        discount_percent = 15
        print("Regular discount: 15%")
        
    discount_amount = purchase_amount * (discount_percent / 100)
    final_price = purchase_amount - discount_amount
    
    print("Discount amount: $", discount_amount)
    print("Final price: $", final_price)
    
elif purchase_amount >= 100:
    if is_member:
        discount_percent = 15
        print("Member discount: 15%")
    else:
        discount_percent = 10
        print("Regular discount: 10%")
        
    discount_amount = purchase_amount * (discount_percent / 100)
    final_price = purchase_amount - discount_amount
    
    print("Discount amount: $", discount_amount)
    print("Final price: $", final_price)
else:
    print("No discount available")
    print("Spend $100 or more for discount!")
    print("Final price: $", purchase_amount)

# Output:
# Shopping Cart
# Subtotal: $ 250
# Member discount: 25%
# Discount amount: $ 62.5
# Final price: $ 187.5
```

## Common Mistakes

Let's look at errors beginners often make!

### Mistake 1: Forgetting the Colon

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18  # Missing colon!
    print("Adult")
```

**Error Message:**
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:  # Don't forget the colon!
    print("Adult")
```

### Mistake 2: Wrong Indentation

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
print("Adult")  # Not indented!
```

**Error Message:**
```
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")  # Properly indented (4 spaces)
```

### Mistake 3: Using = Instead of ==

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
age = 18
if age = 18:  # Single = is assignment, not comparison!
    print("Adult")
```

**Error Message:**
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
age = 18
if age == 18:  # Double == for comparison
    print("Adult")
```

### Mistake 4: Confusing elif and else Order

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
score = 75
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
else:
    print("Not A")
elif score >= 80:  # elif cannot come after else!
    print("B")
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
score = 75
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:  # elif comes BEFORE else
    print("B")
else:
    print("Not A or B")
```

### Mistake 5: Missing Indentation in else

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
age = 15
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
print("Minor")  # else block not indented!
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
age = 15
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")  # Properly indented
```

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This:

1. **Use Meaningful Condition Names**
   ```python
   # Good
   is_eligible = age >= 18 and is_citizen
   if is_eligible:
       print("Can vote")
   
   # Instead of
   if age >= 18 and is_citizen:
       print("Can vote")
   ```

2. **Keep Conditions Simple**
   ```python
   # Good - easier to read
   is_adult = age >= 18
   has_permission = is_citizen and has_id
   
   if is_adult and has_permission:
       print("Access granted")
   
   # Instead of complex one-liner
   if age >= 18 and is_citizen and has_id:
       print("Access granted")
   ```

3. **Use Consistent Indentation**
   - Always use 4 spaces (or 1 tab)
   - Be consistent throughout your code
   - Most code editors do this automatically

4. **Add Comments for Complex Logic**
   ```python
   # Check if user qualifies for premium membership
   if total_purchases >= 1000 and account_age > 365:
       membership_type = "Premium"
   ```

5. **Handle All Cases**
   ```python
   # Good - handles all possibilities
   if score >= 50:
       print("Pass")
   else:
       print("Fail")
   
   # Instead of leaving cases unhandled
   if score >= 50:
       print("Pass")
   # What if score < 50? No message!
   ```

### ❌ Avoid This:

1. **Too Many Nested Levels**
   ```python
   # Avoid - hard to read
   if condition1:
       if condition2:
           if condition3:
               if condition4:
                   # Too deep!
   ```

2. **Comparing Boolean Values**
   ```python
   # Avoid
   if is_active == True:
       print("Active")
   
   # Better
   if is_active:
       print("Active")
   ```

3. **Redundant Conditions**
   ```python
   # Avoid
   if age >= 18:
       is_adult = True
   else:
       is_adult = False
   
   # Better
   is_adult = age >= 18
   ```

## Summary

Congratulations! You've learned how to make Python programs that can make decisions! 🎉

**🎯 Key Takeaways:**

**📌 if Statement**
- Runs code ONLY if condition is True
- Syntax: `if condition:`
- Must use colon and indentation

**📌 else Statement**
- Runs when `if` condition is False
- Provides alternative path
- Syntax: `else:`

**📌 elif Statement**
- Short for "else if"
- Checks additional conditions
- Can have multiple `elif` statements
- Syntax: `elif condition:`

**📌 Nested Conditions**
- `if` statements inside other `if` statements
- Used for complex decision-making
- Don't nest too deep!

**📌 Logical Operators**
- `and` - both must be True
- `or` - at least one must be True
- `not` - reverses the condition

**💡 Remember:**
- Always use a colon (`:`) after `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Indent the code inside (4 spaces)
- Use `==` for comparison, not `=`
- `elif` comes before `else`

**🔑 Quick Reference:**

| Statement | When it Runs | Syntax |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `if` | Condition is True | `if condition:` |
| `elif` | Previous was False, this is True | `elif condition:` |
| `else` | All previous were False | `else:` |

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic if Statement

**Task:** Create a program that checks if a number is positive.

**Requirements:**
- Create a variable `number` and assign it any value
- Use an `if` statement to check if `number > 0`
- If True, print "This is a positive number"

**Hint:** Remember to use proper indentation!

**Expected Output (if number = 5):**
```
This is a positive number
```

---

### Exercise 2: if-else Statement

**Task:** Create a program that checks if a number is even or odd.

**Requirements:**
- Create a variable `number` with any value
- Use `if-else` to check if it's even or odd
- Hint: Even numbers have `number % 2 == 0`

**Expected Output (if number = 7):**
```
7 is an odd number
```

---

### Exercise 3: elif Chain

**Task:** Create a simple calculator that describes a number.

**Requirements:**
- Create a variable `number`
- If number > 0, print "Positive"
- If number < 0, print "Negative"
- If number == 0, print "Zero"

**Expected Output (if number = -3):**
```
Negative
```

---

### Exercise 4: Nested Conditions

**Task:** Create a program to check if someone can get a driver's license.

**Requirements:**
- Create variables: `age` and `has_permit`
- If age >= 18:
  - If has_permit is True: print "You can get a license"
  - Else: print "You need a learner's permit first"
- Else: print "You are too young"

**Test Cases:**
- age = 20, has_permit = True → "You can get a license"
- age = 20, has_permit = False → "You need a learner's permit first"
- age = 16, has_permit = True → "You are too young"

### Exercise 5: Logical Operators

**Task:** Create a scholarship eligibility checker.

**Requirements:**
- Variables: `gpa`, `attendance_percent`, `has_financial_need`
- Eligible if: gpa >= 3.5 AND attendance >= 80 AND has_financial_need is True
- Print "Eligible" or "Not Eligible"

**Test Case:**
- gpa = 3.8, attendance = 85, has_financial_need = True → "Eligible"

### Exercise 6: Grade Calculator Project

**Task:** Build a complete grade calculator.

**Requirements:**
- Take a score variable (0-100)
- Assign grades:
  - 90-100: A (Excellent)
  - 80-89: B (Very Good)
  - 70-79: C (Good)
  - 60-69: D (Pass)
  - Below 60: F (Fail)
- Print the grade and feedback

**Expected Output (if score = 85):**
```
Score: 85
Grade: B
Feedback: Very Good
```

## What's Next?

You've mastered conditional statements! Now you can make programs that think and decide! 🎉

In the next blog, **Chapter 4: Understanding Loops**, you'll learn:

- How to repeat actions automatically
- Using `for` loops to count and iterate
- Using `while` loops for continuous actions
- Breaking out of loops when needed
- Creating patterns and solving repetitive tasks

**Why this matters:** Imagine you want to print "Hello" 100 times. You wouldn't write `print("Hello")` 100 times! Loops let you do it with just 2 lines of code!

**Get ready to:** Automate repetitive tasks and create powerful programs that can do the same thing hundreds or thousands of times!

**Keep practicing!** Try creating your own decision-making programs. Think of everyday decisions and turn them into code. The more you practice, the more natural it becomes!

Remember: Every professional programmer started exactly where you are now. Keep coding! 💪
