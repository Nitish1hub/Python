## What are Operators?

Imagine you're at a calculator shop, and the calculator has buttons like `+`, `-`, `×`, and `÷`. These buttons are **operators** — they tell the calculator what operation to perform on the numbers you input.

In Python, operators work the same way. They are special symbols that tell Python to perform specific operations on values and variables.

**For example:**
```python
result = 5 + 3  # The + operator adds 5 and 3
print(result)   # Output: 8
```

Python supports several types of operators, each designed for different purposes. Let's explore them one by one!

## Arithmetic Operators

Just like in mathematics, Python uses arithmetic operators to perform calculations. These are the most commonly used operators when working with numbers.

### Available Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `+` | Addition | Adds two operands | `5 + 3 = 8` |
| `-` | Subtraction | Subtracts right operand from left | `5 - 3 = 2` |
| `*` | Multiplication | Multiplies two operands | `5 * 3 = 15` |
| `/` | Division | Divides left operand by right (returns float) | `5 / 2 = 2.5` |
| `//` | Floor Division | Divides and returns integer part (divides two numbers and rounds the result down to the nearest whole integer)| `5 // 2 = 2` |
| `%` | Modulus | Returns remainder of division | `5 % 2 = 1` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | Raises left operand to power of right | `5 ** 2 = 25` |

### Understanding Each Operator

**Division (`/`) vs Floor Division (`//`)**

This is an important distinction:
- Regular division (`/`) always returns a decimal (float), even if the result is a whole number
- Floor division (`//`) rounds down to the nearest whole integer

```python
print(10 / 3)   # 3.3333... (float)
print(10 // 3)  # 3 (integer, rounded down)
print(10 / 2)   # 5.0 (still a float!)
print(10 // 2)  # 5 (integer)
```

**Modulus (`%`) — The Remainder Operator**

The modulus operator gives you the remainder after division. It's incredibly useful for:
- Checking if a number is even or odd
- Finding remainders
- Pattern detection

```python
# Understanding modulus - getting remainders
number1 = 8
number2 = 7

print(number1 % 2)  # 0 (8 divided by 2 has no remainder - even number)
print(number2 % 2)  # 1 (7 divided by 2 has remainder 1 - odd number)

# More modulus examples
print(10 % 3)  # 1 (10 ÷ 3 = 3 remainder 1)
print(15 % 4)  # 3 (15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3)
print(20 % 5)  # 0 (20 ÷ 5 = 4 remainder 0)
```

### Practical Examples:

```python
# Basic arithmetic
a = 10
b = 3

print("Addition:", a + b)        # 13
print("Subtraction:", a - b)     # 7
print("Multiplication:", a * b)  # 30
print("Division:", a / b)        # 3.333...
print("Floor Division:", a // b) # 3
print("Modulus:", a % b)         # 1
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b) # 1000

# Practical examples
price = 100
discount = 15
final_price = price - (price * discount / 100)
print("Final Price:", final_price)  # 85.0

# Calculate area of circle
radius = 5
pi = 3.14159
area = pi * radius ** 2
print("Area of circle:", area)  # 78.53975
```

---

## Comparison (Relational) Operators

Comparison operators are like asking questions:
- "Is 5 greater than 3?" → Yes (True)
- "Is 10 equal to 5?" → No (False)

These operators always return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`), making them perfect for decision-making in your programs.

### Available Comparison Operators

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Equal to | Returns True if both operands are equal | `5 == 5` → True |
| `!=` | Not equal to | Returns True if operands are not equal | `5 != 3` → True |
| `>` | Greater than | Returns True if left > right | `5 > 3` → True |
| `<` | Less than | Returns True if left < right | `5 < 3` → False |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | Returns True if left ≥ right | `5 >= 5` → True |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | Returns True if left ≤ right | `3 <= 5` → True |

### Important Notes

**Don't confuse `=` with `==`**
- `=` is for **assignment** (storing a value)
- `==` is for **comparison** (checking equality)

```python
x = 5      # Assignment: store 5 in variable x
print(x == 5)  # Comparison: check if x equals 5 → True
```

**String Comparison**

Strings are compared alphabetically (lexicographically):
```python
print("apple" < "banana")  # True (a comes before b)
print("Apple" < "apple")   # True (uppercase comes before lowercase in ASCII)
```

### Practical Examples:

```python
x = 10
y = 20

print(x == y)  # False
print(x != y)  # True
print(x > y)   # False
print(x < y)   # True
print(x >= 10) # True
print(y <= 15) # False

# String comparison
name1 = "Alice"
name2 = "Bob"
print(name1 == name2)  # False
print(name1 < name2)   # True (alphabetical order)

# Comparing ages
age = 18
min_age = 18
print(age >= min_age)  # True (18 is greater than or equal to 18)
```

---

## Logical Operators

Think of logical operators as the "glue" that combines multiple conditions. They're essential for making complex decisions in your programs.

**Real-world example:**
"You can enter the club if you're 18 or older **AND** you have a valid ID."

Both conditions must be true. That's where the `and` operator comes in!

### Available Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `and` | Returns True if both statements are true | `x > 5 and x < 10` |
| `or` | Returns True if at least one statement is true | `x < 5 or x > 10` |
| `not` | Reverses the result, returns False if True | `not(x > 5)` |

### Understanding Logical Operators with Real Examples

**The `and` Operator**

Both conditions must be `True` for the result to be `True`.

```python
age = 20
has_ticket = True

# Both conditions must be True
can_enter = age >= 18 and has_ticket
print(can_enter)  # True (both conditions are True)

age2 = 16
has_ticket2 = True
can_enter2 = age2 >= 18 and has_ticket2
print(can_enter2)  # False (first condition is False)
```

**The `or` Operator**

At least one condition must be `True` for the result to be `True`.

```python
is_weekend = True
is_holiday = False

# At least one condition must be True
can_relax = is_weekend or is_holiday
print(can_relax)  # True (one condition is True)

is_weekend2 = False
is_holiday2 = False
can_relax2 = is_weekend2 or is_holiday2
print(can_relax2)  # False (both conditions are False)
```

**The `not` Operator**

Reverses a Boolean value.

```python
is_raining = False
can_go_out = not is_raining
print(can_go_out)  # True (not False = True)

is_raining2 = True
can_go_out2 = not is_raining2
print(can_go_out2)  # False (not True = False)
```

### Truth Tables:

Truth tables show all possible combinations of inputs and their results:

**AND operator:**
| A | B | A and B |
|---|---|---------|
| True | True | True |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | False |
| False | False | False |

**OR operator:**
| A | B | A or B |
|---|---|--------|
| True | True | True |
| True | False | True |
| False | True | True |
| False | False | False |

**NOT operator:**
| A | not A |
|---|-------|
| True | False |
| False | True |

### More Practical Examples:

```python
age = 25
has_license = True
has_insurance = False

# AND operator - both must be True
can_drive = age >= 18 and has_license
print("Can drive:", can_drive)  # True

# OR operator - at least one must be True
has_document = has_license or has_insurance
print("Has document:", has_document)  # True

# NOT operator - reverses the value
needs_insurance = not has_insurance
print("Needs insurance:", needs_insurance)  # True

# Complex conditions
score = 85
attendance = 90
passed = score >= 80 and attendance >= 75
print("Passed with distinction:", passed)  # True

# Multiple conditions combined
x = 15
result = x > 10 and x < 20 and x % 5 == 0
print("x meets all conditions:", result)  # True
```

---

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are shortcuts for storing and updating values in variables. They make your code cleaner and more efficient.

### The Basic Assignment Operator

The simple `=` operator stores a value in a variable:

```python
name = "Alice"    # Store "Alice" in variable name
age = 25          # Store 25 in variable age
```

### Compound Assignment Operators

These operators perform an operation **and** assign the result in one step.

**Instead of writing:**
```python
x = x + 5
```

**You can write:**
```python
x += 5
```

Both do the same thing, but the second is shorter and clearer!

### Available Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example | Equivalent to | Description |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| `=` | `x = 5` | `x = 5` | Simple assignment |
| `+=` | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3` | Add and assign |
| `-=` | `x -= 3` | `x = x - 3` | Subtract and assign |
| `*=` | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3` | Multiply and assign |
| `/=` | `x /= 3` | `x = x / 3` | Divide and assign |
| `//=` | `x //= 3` | `x = x // 3` | Floor divide and assign |
| `%=` | `x %= 3` | `x = x % 3` | Modulus and assign |
| `**=` | `x **= 3` | `x = x ** 3` | Exponent and assign |
| `&=` | `x &= 3` | `x = x & 3` | Bitwise AND and assign |
| `\|=` | `x \|= 3` | `x = x \| 3` | Bitwise OR and assign |
| `^=` | `x ^= 3` | `x = x ^ 3` | Bitwise XOR and assign |
| `>>=` | `x >>= 3` | `x = x >> 3` | Right shift and assign |
| `<<=` | `x <<= 3` | `x = x << 3` | Left shift and assign |

### Practical Examples:

```python
# Simple assignment
x = 10
print(x)  # 10

# Add and assign
x += 5    # Same as: x = x + 5
print(x)  # 15

# Subtract and assign
x -= 3    # Same as: x = x - 3
print(x)  # 12

# Multiply and assign
x *= 2    # Same as: x = x * 2
print(x)  # 24

# Divide and assign
x /= 4    # Same as: x = x / 4
print(x)  # 6.0

# Floor divide and assign
x //= 2   # Same as: x = x // 2
print(x)  # 3.0

# Modulus and assign
x = 10
x %= 3    # Same as: x = x % 3
print(x)  # 1

# Exponent and assign
x = 2
x **= 3   # Same as: x = x ** 3
print(x)  # 8

# Practical example
counter = 0
counter += 1  # Increment
counter += 1
print("Counter:", counter)  # 2

total = 100
total -= 20   # Deduct
print("Total:", total)  # 80
```

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators work at the binary level (0s and 1s). They're used in:
- Low-level programming
- Performance optimization
- Working with flags and permissions
- Cryptography and data compression

**Don't worry if this seems advanced!** Bitwise operators are not commonly used in everyday Python programming, but they're powerful tools for specific use cases.

### Understanding Binary

Before diving in, remember that computers store everything in binary:
- 5 in binary is `0101`
- 3 in binary is `0011`

### Available Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `&` | AND | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 | `5 & 3 = 1` |
| `\|` | OR | Sets each bit to 1 if one of the bits is 1 | `5 \| 3 = 7` |
| `^` | XOR | Sets each bit to 1 if only one bit is 1 | `5 ^ 3 = 6` |
| `~` | NOT | Inverts all the bits | `~5 = -6` |
| `<<` | Left shift | Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right | `5 << 1 = 10` |
| `>>` | Right shift | Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit | `5 >> 1 = 2` |

### How Bitwise Operators Work

```python
# Let's see how bitwise AND works:
5 = 0101 (binary)
3 = 0011 (binary)
& ------
    0001 = 1 (decimal)

# Only positions where BOTH bits are 1 become 1 in the result
```

### Practical Examples:

```python
a = 5   # Binary: 0101
b = 3   # Binary: 0011

print("AND:", a & b)     # 1 (Binary: 0001)
print("OR:", a | b)      # 7 (Binary: 0111)
print("XOR:", a ^ b)     # 6 (Binary: 0110)
print("NOT:", ~a)        # -6
print("Left Shift:", a << 1)   # 10 (Binary: 1010)
print("Right Shift:", a >> 1)  # 2 (Binary: 0010)

# Practical use: checking permissions
READ = 4    # 0100
WRITE = 2   # 0010
EXECUTE = 1 # 0001

permissions = READ | WRITE  # 6 (0110)
print("Has read?", bool(permissions & READ))    # True
print("Has execute?", bool(permissions & EXECUTE))  # False
```

## Membership Operators

Membership operators answer the question: "Is this value in that collection?"

They're incredibly useful when working with:
- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets

### Available Membership Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `in` | Returns True if value is found in the sequence | `'a' in 'apple'` → True |
| `not in` | Returns True if value is not found in the sequence | `'b' not in 'apple'` → True |

### Understanding Membership Operators

**With strings:**
```python
email = "user@example.com"
has_at_symbol = "@" in email
print("Has @ symbol:", has_at_symbol)  # True

has_dot = "." in email
print("Has dot:", has_dot)  # True
```

**With lists:**
```python
shopping_cart = ["apple", "bread", "milk"]
has_eggs = "eggs" in shopping_cart
print("Has eggs:", has_eggs)  # False

needs_eggs = "eggs" not in shopping_cart
print("Needs eggs:", needs_eggs)  # True
```

### Practical Examples:

```python
# With strings
text = "Hello World"
print('H' in text)      # True
print('h' in text)      # False (case-sensitive)
print('z' not in text)  # True

# With lists
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print('apple' in fruits)      # True
print('orange' not in fruits) # True

# With tuples
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(3 in numbers)     # True
print(10 in numbers)    # False

# With dictionaries (checks keys)
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
print('name' in person)     # True
print('address' in person)  # False

# Practical use - checking user access
allowed_users = ['admin', 'user1', 'user2']
current_user = 'user1'

is_allowed = current_user in allowed_users
print("Is user allowed:", is_allowed)  # True

# Checking for unauthorized user
unknown_user = 'hacker'
is_unauthorized = unknown_user not in allowed_users
print("Is unauthorized:", is_unauthorized)  # True
```

---

## Identity Operators

Identity operators check if two variables point to the **same object in memory**, not just if they have the same value.

**Think of it this way:**
- `==` asks: "Do these have the same value?"
- `is` asks: "Are these the exact same object?"

It's like asking if two people have the same name (`==`) versus asking if two people are literally the same person (`is`).

### Available Identity Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `is` | Returns True if both variables are the same object | `x is y` |
| `is not` | Returns True if both variables are not the same object | `x is not y` |

### Understanding `is` vs `==`

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a == b)  # True (same values)
print(a is b)  # False (different objects in memory)
print(a is c)  # True (both point to the same object)
```

**When to use `is`:**
- Checking for `None` (always use `is None`)
- Checking object identity in advanced programming

**When to use `==`:**
- Comparing values (most common use case)

### Practical Examples:

```python
# With numbers (cached for small integers)
a = 5
b = 5
print(a is b)  # True (Python caches small integers)

# With lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = list1

print(list1 == list2)     # True (same values)
print(list1 is list2)     # False (different objects)
print(list1 is list3)     # True (same object)

# Checking None
value = None
print(value is None)      # True
print(value is not None)  # False

# Another None example
data = "Hello"
print(data is None)       # False
print(data is not None)   # True

# With strings (interning)
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "hello"
print(s1 is s2)  # True (string interning)

s3 = "hello world"
s4 = "hello world"
print(s3 is s4)  # May be True or False depending on Python implementation
```

---

## Operator Precedence

Just like in mathematics where you do multiplication before addition (remember PEMDAS?), Python follows a specific order when evaluating expressions with multiple operators.

**Example:**
```python
result = 2 + 3 * 4
print(result)  # 14, not 20!
```

Why? Because `*` (multiplication) has higher precedence than `+` (addition), so Python calculates `3 * 4 = 12` first, then adds `2`.

### Why Precedence Matters

```python
# Without understanding precedence:
result = 10 + 5 * 2
print(result)  # You might expect 30, but you get 20

# Using parentheses for clarity:
result = (10 + 5) * 2
print(result)  # Now you get 30
```

**Pro Tip:** When in doubt, use parentheses! They make your code clearer and prevent bugs.

### Precedence Table (Highest to Lowest)

Here's the order Python follows when evaluating operators:

1. `**` (Exponentiation)
2. `~`, `+`, `-` (Unary NOT, plus, minus)
3. `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` (Multiplication, Division, Floor division, Modulus)
4. `+`, `-` (Addition, Subtraction)
5. `>>`, `<<` (Right and left bitwise shift)
6. `&` (Bitwise AND)
7. `^` (Bitwise XOR)
8. `|` (Bitwise OR)
9. `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `is`, `is not`, `in`, `not in` (Comparisons, identity, membership)
10. `not` (Logical NOT)
11. `and` (Logical AND)
12. `or` (Logical OR)

### Step-by-Step Examples

Let's see how Python evaluates complex expressions:

```python
# Without parentheses
result = 2 + 3 * 4
print(result)  # 14 (not 20, because * has higher precedence)

# With parentheses
result = (2 + 3) * 4
print(result)  # 20

# Complex expression
result = 10 + 2 * 3 ** 2
print(result)  # 28 (** first, then *, then +)
# Breakdown: 3**2 = 9, then 2*9 = 18, then 10+18 = 28

# Logical operators
result = True or False and False
print(result)  # True (and has higher precedence than or)
# Breakdown: False and False = False, then True or False = True

# With parentheses
result = (True or False) and False
print(result)  # False

# Practical example - combining conditions
x = 5
y = 10
z = 15

# Without parentheses - can be confusing
result = x > 3 and y < 20 or z == 15
print(result)  # True
# How Python evaluates:
# 1. x > 3 = True
# 2. y < 20 = True
# 3. True and True = True
# 4. z == 15 = True
# 5. True or True = True

# With parentheses - much clearer!
result = (x > 3 and y < 20) or z == 15
print(result)  # True

# Another example with mixed operators
total = 100 + 50 * 2 - 10 / 2
print(total)  # 195.0
# Breakdown:
# 1. 50 * 2 = 100 (multiplication first)
# 2. 10 / 2 = 5.0 (division next)
# 3. 100 + 100 = 200 (addition left to right)
# 4. 200 - 5.0 = 195.0 (subtraction last)
```

**Key Takeaway:** Use parentheses to make your intentions clear, even if they're not strictly necessary!

## Practice Exercises

Now it's your turn to practice! Try solving these exercises to reinforce what you've learned:

### Exercise 1: Basic Arithmetic
Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length 15 and width 8.

**Hint:**
- Area = length × width
- Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

### Exercise 2: Modulus Operator
Use the modulus operator to find the remainder when dividing different numbers:
- What is 17 % 5?
- What is 25 % 7?
- What is 100 % 3?

**Hint:** Use `print()` to display the results

### Exercise 3: Logical Operators
Create variables to check if conditions are met:
- age = 20, is_citizen = True
- Use `and` operator to check: age >= 18 and is_citizen
- Store result in a variable called `can_vote`
- Print the result

### Exercise 4: Compound Assignment
Create a counter using compound assignment operators:
- Start with: `counter = 0`
- Use `counter += 1` to add 1
- Print counter after each addition
- Do this 5 times (write it out 5 times)

### Exercise 5: String Membership
Check if a string contains specific words:
- Create: `text = "I love learning Python programming"`
- Check: `"Python" in text` and `"programming" in text`
- Combine both checks using `and` operator
- Store the result and print it

### Exercise 6: Email Validation
Use membership operators to check email format:
- Create: `email = "user@example.com"`
- Check: `"@" in email`
- Check: `"." in email`
- Use `and` to combine both checks
- Print the result

### Exercise 7: Operator Precedence
Predict the output of this expression before running it:
```python
result = 10 + 5 * 2 ** 2 - 8 / 4
```

Then verify your answer and break down how Python evaluated it step by step.

### Exercise 8: Temperature Converter
Create a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:
- Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32

Test with 25°C (should give 77°F).

---

**Keep practicing!** The more you use these operators, the more natural they'll become. Try combining different operators to create more complex programs!
