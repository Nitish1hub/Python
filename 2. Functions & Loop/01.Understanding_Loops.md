## Introduction - Why Loops?

Imagine you need to print "Hello" 100 times. Would you write this?

```python
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
# ... 97 more times!
```

That would be crazy! There must be a better way, right?

**That's exactly what loops are for!**

With a loop, you can do the same task with just 2 lines:

```python
for i in range(100):
    print("Hello")
```

**Real-world examples of repetition:**
- Checking each item in a shopping cart
- Reading every line in a file
- Sending emails to multiple people
- Counting from 1 to 100
- Processing student grades one by one

**In this blog, you'll learn:**
- How to repeat actions automatically
- Using `for` loops for known repetitions
- Using `while` loops for condition-based repetition
- Controlling loop flow with `break` and `continue`
- Creating patterns and solving repetitive tasks

---

## What is a Loop?

**Define: Loop** - A way to repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it again and again.

**Define: Iteration** - One complete execution of the loop body. If a loop runs 5 times, that's 5 iterations.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of a music playlist:
- The music player **loops** through each song
- Each song playing is one **iteration**
- When all songs are played, the loop ends

Or think of washing dishes:
- **While** there are dishes in the sink → wash one dish (repeat)
- Each dish washed is one iteration
- When sink is empty, stop (loop ends)

### Types of Loops in Python

Python has **two types** of loops:

1. **`for` loop** - Use when you know HOW MANY times to repeat
   - "Print hello 10 times"
   - "Check each item in a list"
   
2. **`while` loop** - Use when you DON'T know how many times (depends on a condition)
   - "Keep asking for password until correct"
   - "Count until user says stop"

---

## The `for` Loop

**Define: `for` loop** - Repeats code a specific number of times or for each item in a sequence.

### Basic Syntax

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to repeat
    # This runs for each item in sequence
```

**Important parts:**
1. `for` keyword
2. Variable name (holds current value)
3. `in` keyword
4. Sequence (what to loop through)
5. Colon (`:`)
6. Indented code block

### Simple Example - Looping Through a String

```python
# Each letter is one iteration
word = "Python"

for letter in word:
    print(letter)

# Output:
# P
# y
# t
# h
# o
# n
```

**What happened?**
1. First iteration: `letter = 'P'`, prints P
2. Second iteration: `letter = 'y'`, prints y
3. Third iteration: `letter = 't'`, prints t
4. And so on... until all letters are done

### Looping Through a List

```python
# We'll learn lists in detail later
# For now, just know: list is a collection of items

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print("I like", fruit)

# Output:
# I like apple
# I like banana
# I like cherry
```

### More Examples

```python
# Example 1: Display numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print("Number:", num)

# Output:
# Number: 1
# Number: 2
# Number: 3
# Number: 4
# Number: 5
```

```python
# Example 2: Calculate sum
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
total = 0

for num in numbers:
    total = total + num
    print("Current total:", total)

print("Final total:", total)

# Output:
# Current total: 10
# Current total: 30
# Current total: 60
# Current total: 100
# Final total: 100
```

---

## The `range()` Function

Often, we want to repeat something a specific number of times. That's where `range()` comes in!

**Define: `range()`** - A function that generates a sequence of numbers.

### Basic Usage

```python
# range(stop) - numbers from 0 to stop-1

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```

**Important:** `range(5)` gives you: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (NOT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Starts at 0 by default
- Stops BEFORE the number you specify

### range() with Start and Stop

```python
# range(start, stop) - numbers from start to stop-1

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
```

### range() with Step

```python
# range(start, stop, step) - count by step

# Count by 2s
for i in range(0, 11, 2):
    print(i)

# Output:
# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
```

```python
# Count backwards
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)

# Output:
# 10
# 9
# 8
# 7
# 6
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
```

### Practical range() Examples

```python
# Example 1: Print "Hello" 10 times
for i in range(10):
    print("Hello")

# Example 2: Multiplication table
number = 5

for i in range(1, 11):
    result = number * i
    print(number, "×", i, "=", result)

# Output:
# 5 × 1 = 5
# 5 × 2 = 10
# 5 × 3 = 15
# ... and so on
```

```python
# Example 3: Sum of first 10 numbers
total = 0

for i in range(1, 11):
    total = total + i

print("Sum:", total)  # 55
```

---

## The `while` Loop

**Define: `while` loop** - Repeats code AS LONG AS a condition is True.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of filling a water bottle:
- **WHILE** the bottle is not full → keep adding water
- When full → stop

The loop continues based on a **condition**, not a fixed number of times.

### Basic Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # Code to repeat
    # Runs as long as condition is True
```

### Simple Example

```python
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count = count + 1  # IMPORTANT: update the counter!

print("Done!")

# Output:
# Count is: 1
# Count is: 2
# Count is: 3
# Count is: 4
# Count is: 5
# Done!
```

**How it works:**
1. Check condition: Is `count <= 5`? Yes (1 <= 5), run code
2. Print count, increase count to 2
3. Check again: Is `count <= 5`? Yes (2 <= 5), run code
4. Repeat until count becomes 6
5. Check: Is `6 <= 5`? No, exit loop

### IMPORTANT: Avoid Infinite Loops!

**Define: Infinite loop** - A loop that never stops because the condition is always True.

```python
# ⚠️ DANGER: Infinite loop! Don't run this!
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print("This will run forever!")
    # Forgot to increase count!
```

**Always remember:**
- Update the variable that controls the condition
- Make sure the condition can eventually become False

### More while Loop Examples

```python
# Example 1: Password attempt
attempts = 0
max_attempts = 3
correct_password = "python123"

while attempts < max_attempts:
    password = "wrong_password"  # Simulating user input
    
    if password == correct_password:
        print("Login successful!")
        break  # Exit loop early
    else:
        attempts = attempts + 1
        print("Wrong password. Attempt", attempts, "of", max_attempts)

if attempts == max_attempts:
    print("Account locked!")

# Output:
# Wrong password. Attempt 1 of 3
# Wrong password. Attempt 2 of 3
# Wrong password. Attempt 3 of 3
# Account locked!
```

```python
# Example 2: Countdown
number = 5

while number > 0:
    print(number)
    number = number - 1

print("Blast off!")

# Output:
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# Blast off!
```

```python
# Example 3: Sum until limit
total = 0
number = 1

while total < 50:
    total = total + number
    print("Added", number, "- Total:", total)
    number = number + 1

# Output:
# Added 1 - Total: 1
# Added 2 - Total: 3
# Added 3 - Total: 6
# Added 4 - Total: 10
# ... continues until total >= 50
```

## Loop Control Statements

Sometimes you need to control the loop flow. Python provides three statements:

### 1. `break` Statement

**Define: `break`** - Immediately exits the loop, no matter what.

Think of it like an emergency exit!

```python
# Stop when we find what we're looking for
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11]

for num in numbers:
    print("Checking:", num)
    
    if num % 2 == 0:  # Found an even number
        print("Found even number:", num)
        break  # Exit loop immediately

# Output:
# Checking: 1
# Checking: 3
# Checking: 5
# Checking: 7
# Checking: 8
# Found even number: 8
```

### 2. `continue` Statement

**Define: `continue`** - Skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next one.

Think of it like "skip this one, move to the next!"

```python
# Skip odd numbers, only print even numbers
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 != 0:  # If odd
        continue  # Skip this iteration
    
    print(i)  # This only runs for even numbers

# Output:
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
```

### 3. `pass` Statement

**Define: `pass`** - Does nothing. Used as a placeholder.

```python
# Use when you need a loop but aren't ready to write code yet
for i in range(5):
    pass  # TODO: Add code later

# No output - it does nothing
```

### Comparing break vs continue

```python
print("=== Using break ===")
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break  # Stop completely when i is 3
    print(i)

print("\n=== Using continue ===")
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skip only when i is 3
    print(i)

# Output:
# === Using break ===
# 1
# 2
# 
# === Using continue ===
# 1
# 2
# 4
# 5
```

---

## Nested Loops

**Define: Nested loop** - A loop inside another loop.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of a digital clock:
- **Outer loop:** Hours (1-12)
- **Inner loop:** Minutes (0-59)
- For each hour, minutes count from 0 to 59

### Basic Example

```python
# Print a pattern
for i in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop: runs 3 times
    for j in range(1, 4):  # Inner loop: runs 3 times for EACH outer iteration
        print(i, j)

# Output:
# 1 1
# 1 2
# 1 3
# 2 1
# 2 2
# 2 3
# 3 1
# 3 2
# 3 3
```

**How it works:**
1. Outer loop: i = 1
   - Inner loop runs completely: j = 1, 2, 3
2. Outer loop: i = 2
   - Inner loop runs completely again: j = 1, 2, 3
3. Outer loop: i = 3
   - Inner loop runs completely again: j = 1, 2, 3

### Practical Nested Loop Examples

```python
# Example 1: Multiplication table (1-5)
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        result = i * j
        print(i, "×", j, "=", result)
    print()  # Empty line after each table

# Example 2: Print a square pattern
size = 5

for i in range(size):
    for j in range(size):
        print("*", end=" ")  # end=" " keeps output on same line
    print()  # New line after each row

# Output:
# * * * * * 
# * * * * * 
# * * * * * 
# * * * * * 
# * * * * *
```

```python
# Example 3: Print a triangle
rows = 5

for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    for j in range(i):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()

# Output:
# * 
# * * 
# * * * 
# * * * * 
# * * * * *
```

## Loop with `else`

Python has a unique feature: loops can have an `else` clause!

**Define: Loop else** - Code that runs after the loop completes normally (not interrupted by `break`).

### How it Works

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed normally!")

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# Loop completed normally!
```

### else with break

```python
# If loop is broken, else doesn't run
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        print("Breaking at", i)
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed normally!")  # This WON'T print

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# Breaking at 3
```

### Practical Use Case

```python
# Search for a value
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
search = 6

for num in numbers:
    if num == search:
        print("Found", search)
        break
else:
    print(search, "not found in list")

# Output:
# 6 not found in list
```

---

## Real-Life Practical Examples

### Example 1: Even Number Counter

```python
# Count how many even numbers in a range

count = 0
for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        count = count + 1
        print(i, "is even")

print("\nTotal even numbers:", count)

# Output:
# 2 is even
# 4 is even
# ... etc
# Total even numbers: 10
```

### Example 2: Factorial Calculator

```python
# Calculate factorial (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120)

number = 5
factorial = 1

for i in range(1, number + 1):
    factorial = factorial * i
    print("Step", i, ":", factorial)

print("\nFactorial of", number, "is", factorial)

# Output:
# Step 1 : 1
# Step 2 : 2
# Step 3 : 6
# Step 4 : 24
# Step 5 : 120
# Factorial of 5 is 120
```

### Example 3: Pattern Printer

```python
# Print number pyramid

rows = 5

for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    # Print numbers from 1 to i
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=" ")
    print()  # New line

# Output:
# 1 
# 1 2 
# 1 2 3 
# 1 2 3 4 
# 1 2 3 4 5
```

### Example 4: Sum Calculator with Input

```python
# Keep adding numbers until user enters 0

print("Enter numbers to add (0 to stop):")
total = 0
count = 0

while True:
    number = 5  # Simulating user input (in real program, use input())
    count = count + 1
    
    # Simulate different numbers
    if count == 1:
        number = 10
    elif count == 2:
        number = 20
    elif count == 3:
        number = 15
    else:
        number = 0
    
    if number == 0:
        break
    
    total = total + number
    print("Added", number, "- Running total:", total)

print("Final sum:", total)

# Output:
# Enter numbers to add (0 to stop):
# Added 10 - Running total: 10
# Added 20 - Running total: 30
# Added 15 - Running total: 45
# Final sum: 45
```

### Example 5: Finding Prime Numbers

```python
# Check if numbers from 2 to 20 are prime

print("Prime numbers from 2 to 20:")

for num in range(2, 21):
    is_prime = True
    
    # Check if num is divisible by any number from 2 to num-1
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    
    if is_prime:
        print(num, "is prime")

# Output:
# 2 is prime
# 3 is prime
# 5 is prime
# 7 is prime
# 11 is prime
# 13 is prime
# 17 is prime
# 19 is prime
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Forgetting to Update Loop Variable

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    # Forgot: count = count + 1
# This creates an infinite loop!
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1  # Always update!
```

### Mistake 2: Off-by-One Error

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
# Want to print 1 to 10, but this prints 0 to 9
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
# Correctly prints 1 to 10
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

### Mistake 3: Modifying List While Looping

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    numbers.remove(num)  # Don't modify list while looping!
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers_to_remove = []

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        numbers_to_remove.append(num)

for num in numbers_to_remove:
    numbers.remove(num)
```

### Mistake 4: Wrong Indentation

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
for i in range(5):
print(i)  # Not indented!
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Properly indented
```

### Mistake 5: Using = Instead of ==

**❌ Wrong Way:**
```python
count = 1
while count = 5:  # Assignment, not comparison!
    print(count)
```

**✅ Correct Way:**
```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:  # Comparison operator
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
```

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This:

1. **Choose the Right Loop Type**
   ```python
   # Use for when you know the count
   for i in range(10):
       print(i)
   
   # Use while when based on condition
   while user_answer != "quit":
       # process
       pass
   ```

2. **Use Meaningful Variable Names**
   ```python
   # Good
   for student in students:
       print(student)
   
   # Avoid
   for x in y:
       print(x)
   ```

3. **Keep Loop Body Simple**
   ```python
   # Good - easy to read
   for num in numbers:
       if num % 2 == 0:
           print(num)
   
   # Avoid complex nested logic when possible
   ```

4. **Initialize Properly**
   ```python
   # Good - clear initialization
   total = 0
   for num in numbers:
       total = total + num
   ```

5. **Use break for Early Exit**
   ```python
   # Good - exit when found
   for item in items:
       if item == target:
           print("Found!")
           break
   ```

### ❌ Avoid This:

1. **Infinite Loops**
   ```python
   # Avoid
   while True:
       print("This runs forever!")
   ```

2. **Too Many Nested Loops**
   ```python
   # Avoid - hard to read and slow
   for i in range(100):
       for j in range(100):
           for k in range(100):
               # Too deep!
   ```

3. **Empty Loop Bodies**
   ```python
   # Avoid
   for i in range(10):
       pass  # Why have the loop?
   ```

## Summary

Congratulations! You've mastered one of the most powerful programming concepts - loops! 🎉

**🎯 Key Takeaways:**

**📌 for Loop**
- Use when you know HOW MANY repetitions
- Syntax: `for variable in sequence:`
- Perfect for iterating through collections
- Works with strings, lists, range()

**📌 range() Function**
- Generates sequence of numbers
- `range(stop)` - 0 to stop-1
- `range(start, stop)` - start to stop-1
- `range(start, stop, step)` - custom increment

**📌 while Loop**
- Use when repetition depends on a CONDITION
- Syntax: `while condition:`
- Must update the condition variable
- Watch out for infinite loops!

**📌 Loop Control**
- `break` - Exit loop immediately
- `continue` - Skip to next iteration
- `pass` - Placeholder, does nothing

**📌 Nested Loops**
- Loop inside another loop
- Inner loop completes for each outer iteration
- Useful for patterns, tables, 2D data

**📌 Loop else**
- Runs if loop completes normally
- Doesn't run if loop exits via `break`
- Useful for search operations

**💡 Remember:**
- Always update loop variables in while loops
- Use proper indentation
- Choose the right loop type
- Avoid infinite loops
- Keep loop bodies simple

**🔑 Quick Reference:**

| Loop Type | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `for` | Known repetitions | `for i in range(10):` |
| `while` | Condition-based | `while count < 10:` |
| `break` | Exit loop early | `if found: break` |
| `continue` | Skip iteration | `if skip: continue` |

## What's Next?

You've mastered loops - you can now make Python repeat actions automatically! 🎉

In the next blog, **Chapter 5: Introduction to Functions**, you'll learn:

- How to create reusable blocks of code
- Writing your own functions
- Parameters and return values
- Variable scope (where variables exist)
- **Introduction to recursion** (functions that call themselves - an alternative to loops!)
- Making your code organized and professional

**Why this matters:** Right now, if you want to use the same code twice, you copy-paste it. Functions let you write it once and use it anywhere! This makes your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more professional.

**Exciting preview:** You'll also learn about **recursion** - a mind-bending technique where a function calls itself to solve problems! It's an elegant alternative to loops for certain types of problems (like calculating factorials or traversing tree structures).

**Get ready to:** Level up your coding by creating your own custom commands that you can reuse throughout your programs!

**Keep practicing!** Loops are fundamental to programming. Try creating different patterns, calculators, and games. The more you practice, the more natural it becomes!

Remember: Every complex program is built on these simple foundations. You're doing great! 💪
